I'm an [AI Researcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ai-researcher/) currently focusing on AI Safety and developing safe AI super-intelligence. Im also a Political Scientist, and i'm deeply concerned about how to safeguard human institutions and society from the impending intelligence explosion. 

My research focuses on AI safety and safe super-intelligence. Below are some of the main areas I am interested in:

1. Superalignment
2. Scalable Oversight
3. Societal Impact

Broadly, I am interested in exploring how we can develop AI systems that are not only highly capable, but also deeply aligned with human values and the wellbeing of society. This encompasses the technical challenges of 'aligning' superintelligent AI systems, as well as the critical questions of how we can ensure the societal and institutional impacts of advanced AI are positive and beneficial.
